Standard armament on the F6F-3 consisted of six .50 in (12.7 mm) M2/AN 
Browning air-cooled machine guns with 400 rpg

There is one possible variation:

"While all F6F-5s were capable of carrying an armament mix of one 20 
mm (.79 in) M2 cannon in each of the inboard gun bays (220 rpg), along 
with two pairs of .50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns (each with 400 rpg), 
this configuration was only used on many later F6F-5N night 
fighters.[21] The F6F-5 was the most common variant with 7,870 being 
built."
